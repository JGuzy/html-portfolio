<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Joel Guzman. I am 31 years old. My family is originally from Tijuana, Mexico. I grew up in southern California 
   and have been livig in North Carolina for 14 years now. I met my wife, Brittany, here and we now have three beautiful kids;
   Taylor (7), Luca (4), and Nash who is only a month old, as of me typing this.</p>

<p>I serve as an ecclesiastical leader in my church and work a lot with the youth. Apart from Sunday responsibilities, we meet
   with our youth for activities on Wednesday nights. Any free time is dedicated to time with my family. I like volunteering at
   schools or sports teams. If after all that I have any spare time, I enjoy bladesmithing. I'm a fan of the NBA and have always 
   been a Lakers fan, having grown up near Los Angeles.</p>

<p>I have an Associate's degree in Spanish translation and interpretation, as well as a Bachelor's degree in business management.
   Professionally, I've done some retail, restaurant. and construction work. Most notably, I've worked as a parent liaison at a
   middle school where I mostly translated documents and interpreted for the Spanish speaking community. Now, I work as a data
   center systems specialist for a bank where I install hardware in their test and production data centers.
