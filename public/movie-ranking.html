<h1>The Best Movies According to Joel</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p>All 3 movies are hilarious. If you're into silly humor like me, these movies are for you. The 2nd movie is probably my favorite of the 3</p>
<h3>The Fast and the Furious</h3>
<p>The whole franchise is good. They went from cool movies about street racing to ridiculous, over-the-top movies about international espionage. What's not to love?</p>
<h3>Nacho Libre</h3>
<p>Nachoooooooooooooooooooooo... Enough said.</p>
